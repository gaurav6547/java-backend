Processing and Analyzing Large Dataset with Parallel Stream

Scenario:
Imagine you have a list of customer orders, and you need to:

* Filter out canceled orders.
* Compute the total value of completed orders.
* Generate a summary of top customers based on their total spending.
* The dataset is large, so processing it in parallel can improve performance.
