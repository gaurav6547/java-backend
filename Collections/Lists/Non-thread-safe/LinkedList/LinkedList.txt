2. LinkedList (Uses Doubly Linked List Internally)

✅ Internal Data Structure: Doubly Linked List
✅ Memory Location: Heap Memory
✅ Framework: Java Collections Framework (JCF)

🔹 LinkedList stores each element in a node, which contains:
1. Data
2. Pointer to the next node (next)
3.Pointer to the previous node (prev)

🔹 Performance:

✅ Fast insert/delete (O(1)) since no shifting is needed.
❌ Slow access (O(n)) as it traverses nodes one by one.
