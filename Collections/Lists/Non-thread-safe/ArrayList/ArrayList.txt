1. ArrayList (Uses Dynamic Array Internally)
Internal Data Structure: Resizable dynamic array
✅ Memory Location: Heap Memory
✅ Framework: Java Collections Framework (JCF)

🔹 How ArrayList Grows Internally?
* Default initial capacity = 10 (if no size is provided)
* When full, it increases by 50% (newCapacity = oldCapacity + oldCapacity/2)

🔹 Performance:
✅ Fast for indexing (O(1)) because it uses an array.
❌ Slow for insert/delete (O(n)) because shifting occurs.
