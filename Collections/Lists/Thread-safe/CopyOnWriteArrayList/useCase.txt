1. Dynamic Configuration Management
Scenario: A system where application settings or configurations need to be updated at runtime without stopping the application.
Example:
A server that adjusts feature flags dynamically based on environment conditions.
A microservices architecture where multiple services read shared configurations, while an admin service updates them.
Implementation:
Readers represent the services accessing configurations.
The updater represents the admin service modifying the configurations.
2. Real-Time Monitoring Systems
Scenario: A monitoring tool reads system metrics (e.g., CPU, memory, etc.) while configuration changes (e.g., thresholds or monitoring rules) are applied on-the-fly.
Example:
A monitoring dashboard where multiple clients query system statuses while administrators update the monitoring rules.
3. Software Feature Toggles
Scenario: Managing feature toggles where threads read the current state of feature availability, and updates reflect new states.
Example:
A system enabling/disabling features like dark mode, beta features, or AB testing toggles dynamically.
4. Thread-Safe Shared Data Management
Scenario: Applications where multiple threads operate on shared data, such as reading logs or event streams, while new data is being added.
Example:
A distributed event-processing system where multiple consumers read from a shared list while producers add new events.
5. Live Update for Client Applications
Scenario: Applications that push live updates to client devices without disrupting existing sessions.
Example:
A live sports score application where multiple clients poll or subscribe to the current scores while the server updates them dynamically.
