5. ConcurrentHashMap (Thread-Safe HashMap)
✅ Internal Data Structure: Segmented Hash Table (Uses Locking)
✅ Memory Location: Heap Memory
✅ Framework: java.util.concurrent

🔹 ConcurrentHashMap is an optimized thread-safe version of HashMap.

java
Copy
Edit
ConcurrentHashMap<String, Integer> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
🔹 Internal Structure:

Uses Segmented Buckets (Partitioned Locks) for better concurrency.
Unlike Hashtable, which locks the whole table, ConcurrentHashMap locks only a portion of the table.
🔹 Performance:

✅ Faster than Hashtable because it locks only segments (O(1)).
❌ More memory overhead than HashMap due to additional segments.
