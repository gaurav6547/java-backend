7. TreeMap (Uses Red-Black Tree)
✅ Internal Data Structure: Self-Balancing Red-Black Tree
✅ Memory Location: Heap Memory
✅ Framework: Java Collections Framework (JCF)

🔹 TreeMap stores key-value pairs in sorted order.

TreeMap<Integer, String> map = new TreeMap<>();
🔹 Performance:

✅ O(log n) complexity for search, insert, delete (tree-based balancing).
❌ Slower than HashMap (O(1)) for lookup operations.
