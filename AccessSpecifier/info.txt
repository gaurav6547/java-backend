* Access Specifiers in Java:
1. public: Accessible from anywhere.
2. protected: Accessible within the same package and by subclasses in other packages.
3. default (no modifier): Accessible only within the same package.
4. private: Accessible only within the same class.



1. Encapsulation (Key Principle of OOP)
What it means: Encapsulation involves hiding the internal details of a class and exposing only the necessary parts.
How getters help: By marking fields private and providing public getter methods, you control how external code accesses the data. This prevents direct modification and allows you to enforce rules around data access.


2. Control Over Data Access
Why it’s important: You can customize the logic in the getter to validate or process data before providing it.



3. Read-Only Access
Why it’s important: You can provide read-only access to a field by defining only a getter without a setter. This ensures data cannot be modified from outside the class.



4. Data Validation and Logic
Why it’s important: You can add business logic in getters to return values based on conditions.





5. Loose Coupling and Future Changes
What it means: If you decide to change the internal implementation of a class (e.g., renaming or removing fields), the getter method interface can stay the same, ensuring existing code using the class doesn’t break.



6. Debugging and Logging
Why it’s useful: You can include debugging or logging logic inside getter methods to track how and when data is accessed.




7. Adherence to JavaBean Standards
Why it’s important: In Java, many frameworks (e.g., Spring, Hibernate) and libraries rely on getter methods for accessing fields. These frameworks assume a class follows JavaBean conventions, where fields are accessed via getFieldName() and setFieldName() methods.
